    "# Logistic Regression on Titanic Survivorship\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook performs a simple logistic regression on the data from the Kaggle project on predicting survivorship of the passengers of the Titanic.  We also grade the results by using the full survivorship data that was downloaded from [Vanderbuilt Biostats](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/Main/DataSets) from the file titanic3.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important that the column names between these various csv's match and that the passenger names match as well so that we can perform table merges correctly.  The Kaggle data has capitalized column names while the Vanderbuilt does not, so I modified titanic3.csv so that, where appropriate, the column names match.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, these two data sources treat embedded double quotes differently.  The Vanderbuilt data is consistent, but the Kaggle date is really borked on this one.  So I removed all embedded double quotes from the files.  This can be done by the following shell commands.\n",
